Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I assure you, it's much more serious than that.
Bill Shankly
It may come as a surprise to many, but football has a long and interesting history; sources suggest that the sport was first introduced in England as early as 1170 when an account describes youths going to the fields for a ‘game of ball’. Aspects of the game can even be traced back to as early as the second and third century BC in China. Sources taken from military manuals at the time describe an exercise called Tsu’ Chu, in which opponents used a leather ball filled with feathers and hair. The aim was to get the ball into a small net fixed on to bamboo canes while also defending themselves from attacks. Variations of the game are also documented in Egyptian and Greek society, proving that the sport has a long tradition throughout history.

In comparison to China’s advanced version of the football itself, the English equivalent was made using an inflated animal bladder. The game’s appeal continued to increase in England so much so that in the 1300s, its popularity became a bone of contention for Edward II. The king became increasingly concerned that football was distracting people from practising archery, at a time when he was preparing to go to war with Scotland. The solution to this problem was to enforce a ban on everyone playing football. This was to be the first of many bans to be instituted by leading figures such as Edward III, Henry IV and Oliver Cromwell.

Nevertheless, football re-emerged and continued to increase in popularity, particularly amongst the working classes, who saw the game as an opportunity to channel their grievances and socialise with people from similar backgrounds. But these matches did not always end in a civilised manner; with limited rules and no referees at the time, the pitch often became violent. It was acceptable to beat or punch opposing team players including destroying their personal property and even, on occasion, their homes or businesses. Volumes of players also varied in some circumstances to as many as 1000 people at any one time, so it wasn't surprising that football matches often spiralled out of control. It became such a problem in the 1800s that a highway act was eventually introduced in 1830, stating that those who played football on highways would be required to pay a fine.

Football's appeal transcended the class divisions, becoming extremely popular at public schools during the 18th century. This provided the context for specific rules to be created for the game. An 1848 meeting at Cambridge drew up rules outlining goal kicks, throw ins and goalies' rights, all of which are still included today. These small stepspaved the way for the rise of football club teams and national and international games and championships.

The British have also been considered instrumental at spreading the game, in its modern inception, across the world. The first ever match recorded outside of Europe was in Argentina in 1867, led by several Englishmen working abroad at the time.

Though football was considered a male sport, it was not exclusively played by men; women have been involved in the game since the late nineteenth century. It became increasingly popular during World War I when women had taken on the jobs traditionally done by men. Those in industrial labour regularly met to play. A ladies team from Preston was one of the first to compete in an international game against Paris. There was a brief ban after World War I made by the Football Association who deemed women’s football to be inappropriate. However, the formation of the English Women’s FA saw the ban eventually lifted in 1971. Since then women’s football has continued to grow in Britain and abroad. Some of the largest football clubs such as Arsenal, Everton and Chelsea all have female teams which compete at home and internationally.

Football has become a much loved part of British culture, and has been instrumental in causing change. Possibly the strangest match took place during World War I, a period of history epitomised by bloodshed and death on massive scales. On Christmas eve of 1914, upon hearing German troops singing carols, both sides walked on to no mans land and played a game of football. While it is not known who won that day, this was to be the only time in the trenches where artillery fire ceased. The Christmas Day Truce of 1914, as it became known, highlights the impact football has had in this country, and indeed the world, and helps explain why it is the nation’s favourite pasttime.

Football has also been mired by both tragedy and controversy, as seen by the Hillsborough Disaster of 1989, in which 96 people were crushed to death. In another incident, referred to as the Heysel Stadium Disaster (1985), a large group of Liverpool fans breached a fence separating them from Juventus fans; the resultant death of 32 people led to English football clubs being banned by UEFA from all European competitions until the early 1990s and a number of Liverpool fans being prosecuted for manslaughter.

The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was a defining moment for a nation that until 1994 was under a regime of apartheid. It was hoped that the biggest sports event in the world would bring prosperity to the host country and show the rest of the world a different side of Africa. Football has certainly come a long way from its humble beginnings hundreds of years ago.

Only three teams have won the FA Cup without conceding a single goal during the entire competition. Don't expect to see any footage though. The Wanderers, who won it in 1873, Preston North End in 1889, and Bury in 1903.
In 1954 Turkey knocked out Spain from during a World Cup qualifier by drawing straws. Blindfolded Italian boy Luigi Franco Gemma picked the straws to decide the winner.
Andrew Watson was the world's first black international player. Born in British Guiana, he was a celebrity in the Victorian era, winning three caps for Scotland in the 1880s. He also became the first non-white player to feature in the FA Cup.
The first World Cup was held in the South American country of Uruguay back in 1930. Thirteen nations took part in the event which saw four European teams make a 15 day boat ride only for three to get knocked out in the 1st round. Uruguay would go on to become world champions, beating Argentina 4-2 in the final.
William Shakespeare refered to football in many of his plays. For example, in King Lear Kent insults Oswald by calling him a ‘base football player’. In Comedy of Errors, Shakespeare writes: 'Am I so round with you as you with me, that like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither if I last in this service you must case me in leather.'
The largest known win in professional football was 36-0 when Arbroath beat Bon Accord in a Scottish Cup match in 1885. More recently, Australia beat American Samoa 31-0 in a 2002 World Cup qualifying match on April 11, 2001. Archie Thompson scored 13 individual goals, an international record.
The Football Association was established in October, 1863. The first meeting took place at the Freeman's Tavern in London. The clubs represented at the meeting included Barnes, Blackheath, Perceval House, Kensington School, the War Office, Crystal Palace, Forest, the Crusaders and No Names of Kilburn.

<h3 ><u>A Brief History of the Game</u></h3>
<h4><u>
Football’s Early Beginnings</u></h4>

<p>Football (as well as rugby and soccer) are believed to have descended from the ancient Greek game of harpaston.   Harpaston is mentioned frequently in classical literature, where it is often referred to as a “very rough and brutal game“.  The rules of this ancient sport were quite simple:  Points were awarded when a player would cross a goal line by either kicking the ball, running with it across the goal line, or throwing it across the line to another player. The other team’s objective was simply to stop them by any means possible.  There was no specific field length, no side line boundaries, no specified number of players per team, only a glaring lack of rules.


Harpaston:  Luckily (for everyone) uniforms & equipment have improved dramatically.

Most modern versions of football are believed to have originated from England in the twelfth century. The game became so popular in England that the kings of that time (Henry II and Henry IV) actually banned football. They believed that football was taking away interest from the traditional sports of England, such as fencing and archery.</p>

<h4><u>Evolution and the Beginnings of Standardization</u></h4>

<p>Football didn’t really begin to take on any consistency of rules and boundaries until it was picked up as a sport in the seven major public schools of England in the early 1800’s.  Six of the seven schools were largely playing the same game (including Eton, Harrow and Winchester) - while the seventh, Rugby School (founded in 1567) was playing a markedly different version of football.

The other schools moved ahead refining their rules and eventually their game became known as "association football" – or soccer, which was played back then much as it is today.

Rugby School went in a different direction.  How and why the game developed differently at Rugby School appears to have been lost in history, but what is known is that by the 1830's, running with the ball at Rugby School was in common use and 18 foot goal posts had been added with a cross-bar at 10 feet above the ground.

The inclusion of the cross-bar was accompanied by a rule that a goal could only be scored by the ball passing over the bar from a place kick or drop kick. Apparently this was done to make scoring easier from further out and also to avoid the horde of defenders standing in and blocking the mouth of the goal.

Players who were able to "touch down" the ball behind the opponents goal line were awarded a "try-at-goal" - the player would make a mark on the goal line and then walk back onto the field of play to a point where a place kick at the goal was possible (a conversion). There was also an "off-your-side" rule used to keep the teams apart.  Passing the ball forward was not allowed.

By the mid-1860s British schools and universities had taken up Rugby's game and honored the school by giving the "new football" the name of rugby.

The game soon went trans-Atlantic to America and landed on fertile soil.</p>

<h4><u>Roots of American Football</u></h4>

<p>The birth date of football in the United States is generally regarded by football historians as November 6, 1869, when teams from Rutgers and Princeton Universities met for the first intercollegiate football game. In those early games, there were 20 players to a team and football still more closely resembled rugby than modern football.

The game of football has a history of constant rule changes. Rule changes have been implemented to bolster the excitement of the game of football and to increase the game's safety.

In 1873, representatives from Columbia, Rutgers, Princeton, and Yale Universities met in New York City to formulate the first intercollegiate football rules for the increasingly popular game. These four teams established the Intercollegiate Football Association (IFA) and set 15 as the number of players allowed on each team.

Walter Camp, the coach at Yale and a dissenter from the IFA over his desire for an eleven man team, helped begin the final step in the evolution from rugby-style play to the modern game of American football. The IFA’s rules committee, led by Camp, soon cut the number of players from fifteen to eleven, and also instituted the size of the playing field, at one hundred ten yards. In 1882 Camp also introduced the system of downs. After first allowing three attempts to advance the ball five yards, in 1906 the distance was changed to ten yards. The fourth down was added in 1912.

Within a decade, concern over the increasing brutality of the game led to its ban by some colleges. Nearly 180 players had suffered serious injuries, and eighteen deaths had been reported from the brutal mass plays that had become common practice. So in 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt called upon Harvard, Princeton, and Yale to help save the sport from demise.

At a meeting between the schools, reform was agreed upon, and at a second meeting, attended by more than sixty other schools, the group appointed a seven member Rules Committee and set up what would later become known as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, or the NCAA.

From this committee came the legalization of the forward pass, which resulted in a redesign of the ball and a more open style of play on the field. The rough mass plays, which once caused so many serious injuries, were prohibited by the committee. Also prohibited was the locking of arms by teammates in an effort to clear the way for their ball carriers. The length of the game was shortened, from seventy to sixty minutes, and the neutral zone, which separates the teams by the length of the ball before each play begins, was also established.</p>
